<h1> Iran </h1>
<h2> What can you do ? </h2>
<pre> 
Iran is not really a torist atraction, many people would rather go other
places than go to a country in the middle east. In Iran they have cities
,so you can go shopping and visit the local towns.Here is a list of what
I would do in Iran,
<ol>
<li> Visit the state capital (Tehran) this city is the 27th largest city<br>
in the world. </li>
<li> eat the local cuisine, Iran's food is centerd around lamb and rice<br>
(two of my most favorite food in the world. They also have really good <br>
spices including saffron.</li>
